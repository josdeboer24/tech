# JokeMatch! dating app
## intro
JokeMatch! is an app that lets people match using jokes. If people like the same jokes, they might get matched! The feature of the app I worked out is the logging in, registrating and making a profile.
## installation
first, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/josdeboer24/tech.git
```
Then, add a .env file in the main folder, containing the following:
```
DB_USER= yourEdit
DB_PASS= yourEdit
DB_HOST= yourEdit
DB_PORT= yourEdit
DB_NAME= yourEdit
SESSION_SECRET= yourEdit;
```

After that, you can install the NPM packages
```
npm install
```

Finally, start the app
```
npm start
```
